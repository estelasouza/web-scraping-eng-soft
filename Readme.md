# SE Web Scrapping

Project for the Software Engineering discipline at UFPE.

Consists of a tool to keep track of the the participation of the students on the strateegia platform 

## INSTRUCTIONS

For now you just have to copy the  HTML containing the answers on the strateegia activity you choose and save it as index.html on the folder you will run the script.
The script will generate a .xsl file with the name of the students who answered the question and the amount of "agrees" they have.
Keep in mind that the project is still a work in progress.
